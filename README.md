# Pascal's Triangle Application

![pascals-triangle-page](/src/IMG/pascals-triangle.png)

This is an application that allows users to select a number from 1 - 9 that will display the number of rows in the triangle.
The current number in the box corresponds to the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
Clicking on each number will also show its X & Y coordinates corresponding to its position in the triangle.
Users can also enable full-screen mode to view the entire display of the Pascal's Triangle.
